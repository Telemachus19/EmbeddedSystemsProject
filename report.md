# Smart Garage & Car Report

## Problem Statement

The objective is to develop an automated parking system that integrates a smart garage with a line follower-enabled car. The system should allow the car to autonomously navigate and park itself in the designated parking spot within the garage, minimizing the need for human intervention.

The key requirements for this system are as follows:

1. **Smart Garage**:

   - The garage should have a designated parking area with line markings on the floor to guide the car's path.
   - The garage should be equipped with sensors or cameras to detect the presence of the car and initiate the auto-parking procedure.
   - The garage should have a control system that can communicate with the car's onboard computer and provide instructions for navigation and parking.

2. **Line Follower-Enabled Car**:

   - The car should have a line follower module, consisting of sensors or cameras, that can detect and follow the line markings on the garage floor.
   - The car's onboard computer should be capable of processing the sensor data, interpreting the line markings, and controlling the car's steering, acceleration, and braking accordingly.
   - The car should be able to receive instructions from the garage's control system and adjust its movements accordingly.

3. **Automated Parking Procedure**:

   - When the car approaches the garage, the garage's sensors should detect its presence and initiate the auto-parking sequence.
   - The garage's control system should communicate with the car's onboard computer, providing necessary instructions and guidance.
   - The car should follow the line markings on the floor, adjusting its speed and direction as needed, until it reaches the designated parking spot.
   - Once the car is parked, the system should provide feedback to the user, confirming the successful completion of the parking operation.

4. **Safety and Error Handling**:

   - The system should incorporate robust safety measures to prevent collisions or damage during the auto-parking process.
   - Fail-safe mechanisms should be in place to handle unexpected situations, such as obstacles on the path or sensor failures.
   - The system should provide clear visual and auditory feedback to the user throughout the parking process.

5. **User Interface and Interaction**:

   - The system should have a user-friendly interface, allowing the user to initiate and monitor the auto-parking process.
   - The interface should provide real-time updates on the car's status and position during the parking operation.
   - The system should offer options for manual override or cancellation of the auto-parking procedure, if necessary.

The automated parking system should be designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integration with other smart home or transportation systems.
